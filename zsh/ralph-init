## Project Overview

<!-- Brief description of the project -->

## Tech Stack

<!-- Languages, frameworks, key dependencies -->

## Quality Gates

Run these before every commit:

```bash
# Example for Rust:
# cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test

# Example for Node:
# npm run lint && npm run test

# Update with your project's commands:

```

## Issue Tracking

This project uses beads for issue tracking. Issues marked **Backlog** are ignored - only work on ready issues.

```bash
bd ready                          # Find available work
bd show <id>                      # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>                     # Complete work
bd create "description"           # Create new issue
```

## Code Conventions

Never run `git clean -fd` without first checking for non-temp untracked files. Use `git clean -n` to preview.

You are an autonomous coding agent working on this project.
Read VISION.md to understand what we're building.
Read AGENTS.md for workflow instructions.
Read RAILS.md for project-specific guardrails and lessons learned.

1. Run 'bd ready' to find available issues. Ignore Backlog issues.
2. Run 'git log --oneline -10' to see recent work.
3. Pick the HARDEST, highest-priority issue. Evaluate the issues yourself; don't just pick the first one.
4. Run 'bd show <id>' to understand the issue, then 'bd update <id> --status in_progress' to claim it.
5. Implement the task. Check RAILS.md for relevant warnings before making changes.
6. Run quality gates (check AGENTS.md for project-specific commands).
   - If tests fail, fix them before proceeding. DO NOT commit broken code.
   - If you cannot fix tests, leave issue in_progress and create a new blocking issue with 'bd create'.
7. For UI changes: visually verify the implementation works as expected.
8. Only after tests pass: commit your changes with a descriptive message.
9. IF there are any instructions in AGENTS.md about documenting breaking changes against a production deployment, MAKE SURE TO DOCUMENT THEM SUCH THAT MIGRATIONS CAN BE SCRIPTED AND EASILY EXECUTED IN THE FUTURE.
10. If you made a significant mistake (repeated twice or major time sink), add an entry to RAILS.md.
11. Run 'bd close <id>' to mark complete.

CRITICAL: ONLY DO ONE TASK. Keep CI green. Every commit must pass all tests.
